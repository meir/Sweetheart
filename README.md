# Sweetheart
Discord Sweetheart bot

Random discord bot that i wanted to make to add biographies for users in discord.
This soon became useless as discord added a biography feature themselves.
It would also feature some random commands just to test the capabilities of what i could add.

Contained a webserver using GraphQL and MongoDB as storage.
Needed a rework to make the GraphQL code more readable and the controllers for it more consistent with data between the webserver and the discord bot.
